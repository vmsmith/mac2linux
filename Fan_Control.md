On thing that happens a lot -- especially if I am using Firefox -- is that the fan starts going bonkers.

Apparently there is an application, [macfanctld](https://www.howtoinstall.co/en/ubuntu/xenial/macfanctld), that can help. The installation seems pretty simple:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install macfanctld

I will try this. The next step is figuring out why Firefox is causing this.
