#### Background

I got my first Mac in 2009 or '10 for my birthday. It was a 15" MacBook Pro. There were a couple of flaws in that initial purchase. 

* First, I didn't realize the memory was hard-wired in and could not be upgraded. 
* Second, I didn't realize that Mac -- the entire PC world probably -- was in the process of switching from hard drives to SSDs, and I got a machine with a hard drive.
* Finally, had I been paying real attention, I would have gotten a 13" instead of a 15" (which is an anchor to carry around).

The main issue turned out to be #2. As the operating systems kept getting upgraded, the Mac kept getting slower and slower to respond. What I finally realized (or was told on Reddit) was that current OS upgrades are optimized for SSDs, and the hard drive was causing all the problems.
